      "description": "Research with the initial vision was to control digital instruments through gestures, much like a conductor, leading to the idea of creating a MIDI version of the Æolian harp—a wind-activated instrument. This concept sought to bridge nature and technology, echoing Heidegger's views on technology as a mode of revealing, allowing the wind's inherent patterns to become audibly evident. However, technical limitations prevented precise detection of the harp strings' vibrations by wind, resulting in a redesigned installation that combined elements of sculpture, wind vane, wind chime, and equipment rack to capture wind patterns."

The result is a unique mixture of traditional African rhythms, dub and free jazz.\n\nFeatures DJ favourite “Stebeni’s Theme” and “Far Away Chant”, used to famously gruesome effect by David Lynch in the film Wild At Heart.\ncredits"

It was directed by John Coney, written by Sun Ra and Joshua Smith, and features Sun Ra and his Arkestra. During the late-1960s and early-1970s, Sun Ra and his ensemble made several forays to California. In 1971, Sun Ra taught a course, \"The Black Man in the Cosmos\", at University of California, Berkeley. Over the course of these California visits, Sun Ra came to the attention of Jim Newman, who produced the film Space Is the Place starring Sun Ra and his Arkestra, and based, in part, on Sun Ra's Berkeley lectures."

      "description": "The People United is a set of 36 variations on the Chilean song \"¡El pueblo unido jamás será vencido!\" by Sergio Ortega and Quilapayún.\nThe song on which the variations is based is one of many that emerged from the Unidad Popular coalition in Chile between 1969 and 1973, prior to the overthrow of the Salvador Allende government. Rzewski composed the variations in September and October 1975, as a tribute to the struggle of the Chilean people against the newly imposed repressive regime of Augusto Pinochet; indeed the work contains allusions to other leftist struggles of the same and immediately preceding time, such as quotations from the Italian traditional socialist song \"Bandiera Rossa\" and the Bertolt Brecht-Hanns Eisler \"Solidarity Song.\"\n\nIn general, the variations are short, and build up to climaxes of considerable force. The 36 variations, following the 36 bars of the tune, are in six groups of six. The pianist, in addition to needing a virtuoso technique, is required to whistle, slam the piano lid, and catch the after-vibrations of a loud attack as harmonics: all of these are \"extended\" techniques in 20th-century piano writing. Much of the work uses the language of 19th-century romanticism, but mixes this language with pandiatonic tonality, modal writing, and even serial techniques.\n\nAs in the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, the final variation is a direct restatement of the original theme, intended to be heard with new significance after the long journey through the variations."

      "description": "Vexations is a musical work by Erik Satie. Apparently conceived for keyboard (although the single page of manuscript does not specify an instrument), it consists of a short theme in the bass whose four presentations are heard alternatingly unaccompanied and played with chords above. The theme and its accompanying chords are written using enharmonic notation. The piece is undated, but scholars usually assign a date around 1893–1894 on the basis of musical and biographical evidence.\nThe piece bears the inscription \"In order to play the motif 840 times in succession, it would be advisable to prepare oneself beforehand, and in the deepest silence, by serious immobilities.\" (\"Pour se jouer 840 fois de suite ce motif, il sera bon de se préparer au préalable, et dans le plus grand silence, par des immobilités sérieuses.\") From the 1960s onward, this text has mostly been interpreted as an instruction that the page of music should be played 840 times,[1][2] although this may not have been Satie's intention."

Water drips through the hole at the top onto a small pool of water inside of the pot, creating a pleasant splashing sound that rings inside of the pot similar to a bell or Japanese zither. It is usually built next to a traditional Japanese stone basin called chōzubachi, part of a tsukubai for washing hands before the Japanese tea ceremony."
